# tinyVM

A mini virtual machine framework.

It has a byte-code runtime and compiler that understands an assembly-like language. It can check for unknown commands, wrong parameter types and more.

*Note: runtime execution is not implemented at the moment. It checks and loads the program, but does not call opcode functions.*
